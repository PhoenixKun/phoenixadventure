     <p>
         You reach the farm and from the verry start you feel like theres something odd.<br> Theres no animal life not even a decent looking farm house or barn, but you go ahead anyway.<br> As you aproach the farm you hear a snap and a voice calls out<br> "Gotcha! you thought you can escape me but you were wrong now die"<br> Your leg is caught and you are being draged away soon before you know it youre upside down<br> "Helo little pig you have escaped from my clutches once but now you will be locked up forever in hell"<br> you try to say your final words before your end but it was too late.
