    <p>You hear a voice the moment you gain consciousness<br>
    "Welcome to necropolis you are here because you're dead why else you would be in the city of the dead unless your a spy from that bastard you misarable mortals call god but, I doubt that will happen unless he wants a war....on another note you are here for one thing and one thing only to find exactly what you're here for and achive your goal but some of u flesh bags might have amnesia so have fun you miserable flesh sacks and dont die hahaha get it because you're dead"<br>
    After the voice dissapeared you started to venture out and you see a tavern but you are scared of the dangers that might come just think has a tavern ever brought anyone good fortune and scince you're complaning necropolis looks fairly moddern to what life was or thats what you can remember</p>
